This is a small library of code-pieces that I find useful in many of my projects. 

It covers areas that I miss in the JDK itself e.g. for arrays and collections, logging, networking stuff, 
as well as helpers for testing.

## Contents

Here an (incomplete) list of bits and pieces in this lib:
* MappedCounter - counting things easily
* DateParser - print out things like "1h 2min ago" instead of "at 2015-04-01 16:23:23"
* ExecutionHelper - More easily run external processes and collect their output using Apache commons-exec underneath
* DeleteOnCloseInputStream - Delete a file as soon as the stream is closed
* SVNLogFileParser - Parse the XML output of 'svn log --xml ...'
* ZipFileCloseInputStream - Close a ZipFile as soon as the related InputStream (usually returned by the ZipFile) is closed
* ZipUtils - utilities for accessing content in Zip files recursively, i.e. access a file in a zip file inside a zip file.

Please note that some testing related pieces were moved into their own library to better separate these things. Look at
http://github.com/centic9/commons-test for more details.
